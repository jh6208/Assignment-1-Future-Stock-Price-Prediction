# QLBS Model in Asset Pricing

The final project analyzes the methods and applications of the Q-Learning Black Scholes Model in pricing a European put option. This model is based
on two articles, "Halperin Fitted Q Iteration.pdf" and "Halperin Q Learner in BSM article.pdf". These two articles briefly discuss the mathematical
rationale behind the applications in dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, the QLBS model's implications, and its comparison
with the classical BS model. More details can be read directly by the pdfs, and the presentation "QLBS_Model_Review.pdf" concluded by me.
