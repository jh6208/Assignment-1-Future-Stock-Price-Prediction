# [NYU Tandon FRE-7773 Jain] Machine Learning Projects
The projects deal with common questions in the machine learning field, including the classcial machine learning, the deep learning, and the reinforcement learning. Some of the projects also tackle the applications on Financial Engineering, including predicting future market states, designing investment strategies, and images classification.

Here is a short catalog briefly discussing each assignment:

***1. Assignment_1_Stock_Price_Prediction:*** 

This first assignment is just a catch up of what most of us have learned already: using the simple linear regression to predict the future stock price of AAPL. The only difference is that in this case we used stock price returns to do the regression, intead of stock prices, to increase our prediction accuracy.

***2. Assignment_2_Investment_2:*** 

This is a short exercise designing an investment strategy in one single stock to predict whether it is overpriced or underpriced. If it is overpriced, then investors should short the stock price; otherwise not short. This is a common investment strategy in finance, and if employed 
appropriately, investors can make a lot of money.
