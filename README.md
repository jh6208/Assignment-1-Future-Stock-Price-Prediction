# [NYU Tandon FRE-7773 Jain] Machine Learning Projects
This is the machine learing projects tackeling common questions in the articial intelligence field, including the applications of future stock price pedictions, future long/short strategies, pairs-trading, and image classicifation. The first six assignments deal with classcial machine learning questions, while the last four ones are on the deep-learning field.
