The projects deal with common questions in the machine learning field, including the classcial machine learning, the deep learning, and the reinforcement learning. Some of the projects also tackle the applications on Financial Engineering, including predicting future market states, designing investment strategies, and images classification.

Here is a short catalog briefly discussing each assignment:

***1. Assignment_1_Stock_Price_Prediction:*** 

This first assignment is just a catch up of what most of us have learned already: using the simple linear regression to predict the future stock price of AAPL. The only difference is that in this case we used stock price returns to do the regression, intead of stock prices, to increase our prediction accuracy.

***2. Assignment_2_Investment_1:*** 

This is a short exercise designing an investment strategy in one single stock to predict whether the stock price's return next day is positive or negative. If it is positive, then investors should go long the stock; otherwise not. This is a common investment strategy in finance, and if employed appropriately, investors can make a lot of money.

***3. Assignment_3_Investment_2:***

The goal of this assignment is to design a simple pairs trading strategy in the S&P 500 ETF and the Dow Jones Industrial ETF, by using the rolling regression and Kalman filtering. Even though not performing well by both methods, this mini project provides a general blueprint for implementing the pairs trading strategy in finance, a common statistical arbitrage approach adopted by investors to earn a profit.

***4. Assignment_4_SVM:***

This is a short exercise whose goal is to let newcomers be familiar with the Support Vector Machines' application in classification. The majority of
the contributions of this assignment is from the textbook "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.pdf", https://www.clc.hcmus.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Hands_On_Machine_Learning_with_Scikit_Learn_and_TensorFlow.pdf,  by the author Géron A., and its corresponding github repository https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2.

***5. Assignment_5_PCA_Applications:***

Being the first assignment in the unsupervised learning field, Assignment 5 utilizes the principal component analysis (PCA) to extract useful features
in predicting the returns for the eign portfolios. It then reports the eign portfolios with the highest returns. The same textbook and Github are useful enough!

***6. Assignment_6_K_Means_Shrink_Correlations_HRP:***

Assignment 6 is a mix of several things: K means clustering, correlation shrinkage, and the Hierarchical Risk Parity to construct the portfolios in finance. Using HRP to construct portfolio in finance is a novel idea and it solves the singularity problem of matrices.

***7. Assignment_7_DNN_MNIST:***

This mini project applies the deep neural networks (DNNs) to the image (clothing) applications. It extracts dataset from MNIST, and then builds up
a variety of DNN models to maximize the accuracy for the classification task. The good news is that almost all of the models did a pretty good job with accuracies close to 90%!

***8. Assignment_8_DNN_Constructions:***

This assignment takes a deep look into the constructions of the DNNs. It includes five steps: DNN Builing Ups, the Applications in Image Classification, Initialization, Optimization, and Regularization. 

* Category: Concept Teachings 

***9. Assignment_9_CNN_Constructions:***

This exercise takes a deep look into the constructions of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

* Category: Concept Teachings 

***10. Assignment_10_RNN_Constructions:***

This exercise takes a deep look into the constructions of the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
