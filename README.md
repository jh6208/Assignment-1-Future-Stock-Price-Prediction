The projects deal with common questions in the machine learning field, including the classcial machine learning, the deep learning, and the reinforcement learning. Some of the projects also tackle the applications on Financial Engineering, including predicting future market states, designing investment strategies, and images classification.

Here is a short catalog briefly discussing each assignment:

***1. Assignment_1_Stock_Price_Prediction:*** 

This first assignment is just a catch up of what most of us have learned already: using the simple linear regression to predict the future stock price of AAPL. The only difference is that in this case we used stock price returns to do the regression, intead of stock prices, to increase our prediction accuracy.

***2. Assignment_2_Investment_1:*** 

This is a short exercise designing an investment strategy in one single stock to predict whether the stock price's return next day is positive or negative. If it is positive, then investors should go long the stock; otherwise not. This is a common investment strategy in finance, and if employed appropriately, investors can make a lot of money.

***3. Assignment_3_Investment_2:***

The goal of this assignment is to design a simple pairs trading strategy in the S&P 500 ETF and the Dow Jones Industrial ETF, by using the rolling regression and Kalman filtering. Even though not performing well by both methods, this mini project provides a general blueprint for implementing the pairs trading strategy in finance, a common statistical arbitrage approach adopted by investors to earn a profit.

***4. Assignment_4_SVM:***

This is a short exercise whose goal is to let newcomers be familiar with the Support Vector Machines' application in classification. The majority of
the contributions of this assignment is from the textbook "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.pdf", https://www.clc.hcmus.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Hands_On_Machine_Learning_with_Scikit_Learn_and_TensorFlow.pdf,  by the author Géron A., and its corresponding github repository https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2.
