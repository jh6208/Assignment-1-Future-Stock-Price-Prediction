# Neural Networks on MNIST

This short exercise is the first assignment on the deep learning field. It classifies clothes on the dataset MNIST using the deep neural networks 
(DNNs). The overall accuracy is close to 90%, indicating that DNNs did a pretty good job! This assignment also contains the folder called "assignment7_best_model", which are two files generated by the main jupyter notebook "Assignment_7.ipynb" after it finishes its run. In addition, the jupyter notebook "classification.ipynb" is a useful resource to guide through this assignment.

*** Knowledge: DNNs, Image Classification ***
