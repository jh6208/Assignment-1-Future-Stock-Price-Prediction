# Deep Neural Network

This assignment contains 5 short exercises to really dig deep into the mechanisms of DNNs. It includes the build-ups of the DNNs, the applications of
it to classify cats in the images, the initialization, optimization, and regularization steps for normal DNNs.

*** Knowledge: DNNs' Build Ups, Classification, Initialization, Optimization, Regularization ***
