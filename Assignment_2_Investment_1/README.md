# Future Investment Strategy 1: Long/Short Stocks

This is the first type of investment strategy, which is just simply longing or shorting stocks in the future to maximize investors' profits. 
The rule is simply is: If the predicted stock price return next day is positive (negative), then investors simply go long (short) the stock to earn the spreads between the stock prices now and future. Note that "Momentum strategy case study.pdf" is the sample case study which this assignment mimics.
