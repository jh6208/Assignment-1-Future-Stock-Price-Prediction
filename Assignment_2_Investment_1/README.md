# Future Investment Strategy 1: Long/Short Stocks

This is the first type of investment strategy, simply longing or shorting stocks in the future to maximize investors' profits. 
The rule is simple: If the predicted stock price return the next day is positive (negative), then investors go long (short) the stock to earn the spreads between the stock prices now and in the future. Note that "Momentum strategy case study.pdf" is the sample case study that this assignment mimics.
