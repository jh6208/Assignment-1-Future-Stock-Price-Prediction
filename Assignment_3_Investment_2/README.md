# Future Investment Strategy 2: Kalman Filtering and Pair Trading

This is the second type of investment method commonly used in finance. This time, we used a pair of highly correlated stocks. And predict whether 
their spread exceeds a certain level. If it exceeds, we go short the one with a higher price than the other. Pairs trading is a statistical
arbitrage, proved to receive smoothly and steadily increasing returns for pairs. However, in this exercise, pairs trading using the Rolling Regression
and Kalman Filter did not perform well, indicating we should find some more advanced machine learning algorithms in this field. Note that this short exercise is based on the "Kalman Filtering Case Study.pdf" file.
