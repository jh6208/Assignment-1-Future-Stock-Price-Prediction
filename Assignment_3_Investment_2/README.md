# Assignment_3_Investment_2: Kalman Filtering and Pair Trading

This is the second type of investment methods commonly used in finance. This time we used a pair of highly correalted stocks. And predict whether 
their spread exceeds a certain level. If exceeds, then we go short the one with a higher price than the other. Pairs trading is a statistical
arbitrage, proved to receive smoothly and steadily increasing returns for pairs. However, in this exercise, pairs trading using the Rolling Regression
and Kalman Filter did not performe well, indicating we should find some more advanced machine learning algorithms in this field.
