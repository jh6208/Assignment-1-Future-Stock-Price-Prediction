# Deep Neural Network Applications: Image Classification


This short exercise is the first assignment in the deep learning field. It classifies clothes on the dataset MNIST using the deep neural networks 
(DNNs). The general accuracy is nearly 90%, indicating that DNNs did well! This assignment also contains the folder called 
"assignment7_best_model", which are two files generated by the main jupyter notebook "Assignment_7.ipynb" after it finishes its run. In addition, 
the jupyter notebook "classification.ipynb" is a valuable resource to guide through this assignment.
